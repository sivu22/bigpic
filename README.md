bigpic is an iOS app that allows the user to browse the images found in the Documents folder of the app. The images are presented in a table, alongside file name, type, resolution and size. big in bigpic refers to really big images, as in 100MB and more.

The app supports interaction with Files (i.e. File Sharing), meaning it's super easy to import images inside the app or remove them. All these changes are presented automatically in the main view, since the Documents folder is being permanently watched for changes.

bigpic supports raster images (.jpeg, ,png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff, .tga, …), RAW image formats (.raw, .cr2, .nef, .dng, …) and even some vector images (.pdf, .ai). Please note, vector images have no resolution, therefore the resolution will be shown as 0x0.
